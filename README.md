# My answers to Advent of Code 2022

## How do I run this?

`cargo run --bin dXX_name`, eg. `cargo run --bin d01_calorie_counting`

## Where should I put the inputs?

`dXX_name/input`

**_The inputs are embedded into the executables, so you will have to recompile the code if you want to change the inputs._**
